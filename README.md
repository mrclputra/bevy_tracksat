# bevy_tracksat

A 3D satellite tracking tool built using the [Bevy](https://bevy.org/) game engine and [SGP4](https://github.com/neuromorphicsystems/sgp4) crate for orbital mechanics.

This was a fun first project for me in familiarizing myself with the Bevy workflow and exploring various PBR techniques.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrclputra/bevy_tracksat.git
cd bevy_tracksat
cargo run --release
```

The executable will be found under `target/release/`

## Controls

- **Right-click + drag** - Rotate camera
- **Mouse wheel** - Zoom
- **Time buttons** - Control simulation speed
- **R** - Reset Camera

## Notes

You can tweak simulation settings in `src/config.rs` for things like terrain height, atmospheric parameters, rotation speed, etc.
You can also try out more TLE datasets from [NORAD](https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/), though you will need to replace the file reference in `systems/satellites/mod.rs`.

Do check out the WGSL shader code
